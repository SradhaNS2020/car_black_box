# car_black_box
This Car Black Box project is a logging system designed to capture and record critical event data in a vehicle using a PIC16F877A microcontroller. The system stores data in EEPROM, allowing for data persistence even after power loss. This project can be adapted for applications such as recording vehicle speed, gear change and collision.

## Features ##
Event Logging: Records event details to EEPROM, ensuring data retention even if power is lost.<br>
Microcontroller: Built with a PIC16F877A microcontroller.<br>
Non-volatile Storage: Uses external EEPROM to store recorded data.<br>
Real-time Monitoring: Captures key events in real-time, useful for post-event analysis.<br>

## Software Requirements ##
MPLAB X IDE: For PIC programming.
XC8 Compiler: To compile and upload the code to the PIC microcontroller.
PicSimLab: Online picgenious board 
Tera Term or Similar Terminal Emulator: For data output and debugging.
